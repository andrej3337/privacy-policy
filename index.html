  <h1>Privacy Policy for My Vocabulary App</h1>
  <p>Effective date: May 18, 2025</p>
  <h2>1. Data Handling</h2>
  <p>
    The My Vocabulary app does not collect or transmit any personal data to third parties. All user data, such as added words, translations, and photos, is stored solely on the user’s device and never leaves it.
  </p>
  <h2>2. Permissions Usage</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><b>Camera:</b> This permission is used only to take photos that users can attach to vocabulary entries. All photos are saved locally and are never shared with developers or any third parties.</li>
    <li><b>Notifications:</b> The app may send reminders and study messages to help users learn vocabulary. Notifications do not contain ads, external links, or prompts for purchases.</li>
  </ul>
  <h2>3. Advertising</h2>
  <p>
    Currently, the app does not show any advertisements. If ads are implemented in the future, only Google-certified, child-directed ad networks will be used in accordance with the Families Policy Requirements.
  </p>
  <h2>4. Security</h2>
  <p>
    We take all reasonable measures to protect user data. The app does not request access to information not related to its core functionality.
  </p>
